# Analytics (Signal Processing)
This is the main analytics module. It serves as the "brain" of the arm in the sense that it analyzes EMG sensor data and the camera feed (eventually) to determine the best grip type and when to apply the grip.

## Installation
```bash
// Install poetry -- follow the instructions here: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
// Clone the repository
cd <REPOSITORY>
poetry install
// Finally, start the analytics module
poetry run python -m analytics
```

## File Structure
TODO!!!
